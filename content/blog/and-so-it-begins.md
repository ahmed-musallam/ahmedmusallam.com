Dramatic much? nope! It's exciting!

I have been wanting to build my own site for quite a while, about 3 years to be exact. I wanted an online "presence"; somewhere I can show off cool things I have been working on. I also wanted to get better at writing, specifically technical writing. I read a lot of developer articles on [Medium](medium.com) and it has inspired me to start writing on my own. In the process, I'd give back to the community and make a name for myself.

## And so it began!
My journey to build this site! There were so many questions to be answered, do I use a CMS? If so, which? Do I use a JS framework? A CSS framework? How about a logo? Ahhhhhhhh!

Those questions would keep looming in my head and I would keep putting this project aside.

## Until one day
I decided to quit being lazy and actually try to do it! I started with a GitHub hosted site with only one placeholder page. It was ok, but not enough, I needed a solution where I can use my own domain, use HTTPS and add pages/blogs easily but still have total control over my site (JS/CSS/HTML). All that, while still being a static site that is blazing fast.

## Picking Hugo and JAMstack
I have tried quite a few solutions before settling on Hugo. I tried Wordpress, GitHub Pages, and even AWS hosting. All had some disadvantages I did not like and won't get into in detail. Then I read this [article](https://medium.com/jamstack/why-your-next-site-should-be-built-with-jam-in-mind-34b9234a272f) and I was curious about [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). I started reading more about it and tried a few static site generators like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but I liked nothing better than [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) It was easy to learn and truly blazing fast (built with Go). It also allowed me the freedom to use any framework on no framework at all.

> Hugo can build this entire site in under ONE SECOND!

## Now I needed to host my Hugo site
[Netlify!](https://www.netlify.com/) I discovered [Netlify!](https://www.netlify.com/). And it was a match made in heaven! Netlify would take my GitHub repo, build it and deploy it to their extremely fast CDN! All this happens automatically upon committing to my GitHub repo. [[guide]](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/)

## About performance... This site KILLS it!
With Hugo being so fast, this site is updated literally 2-3 seconds after I add a commit to my git repo! That's insane! On top of all that, this site loads in 0.3 seconds! That's about the same time it takes you to [blink!](https://sciencing.com/fast-blink-eye-5199669.html) That's as fast as it gets!

## SEO... you guessed it!
This site became the second result in google searches* after my Linkedin profile page! That was an unexpected surprise

>*Searches for "Ahmed Musallam", not that I google my self or anything...


## Closing remarks
Sounded like a cool header, so why not!
On a serious note thou, I have enjoyed building this site and I will soon be adding more technical blogs about AEM, JavaScript and other cool things I'm working on!
