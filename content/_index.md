My name is Ahmed and I'm a developer living in Minnesota. If this is your first time here, welcome! I hope you enjoy this site as much as I've enjoyed building it!

From 9-5, I'm an AEM expert building solutions for some of the worlds top brands! 
Post 5pm I am a husband, father and you guessed it, developer! I try to contribute to the community where I can; by writing open-source software, answering questions on StackOverflow or writing blog posts.

I've built this site to be blazing fast! Mainly because I'm a millennial and I have to live up to the stereotype (we hate waiting, apparently). There is nothing fancy about this site, on purpose! it's minimal and functional and dare I say, looks darn good at it!
